## About

This is my next website project for a company that partners with Bolt/Uber/FreeNow. Design, mockup, coding - everything was on my side.

Why React? Because in the future the website is to turn into an app to respond to the need of people working in the company for an app to facilitate time management and automation - certain business requirements prevent it from being available, so I present the website itself.

## Coding & Problems

Given my experience so far, there were no problems, while the carousel appearing in the blog section and the design of the offer section based on dots was an interesting task.
